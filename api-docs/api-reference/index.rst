API Reference
=============

Learn about the available Rackspace Cloud Identity API resources and methods
and see request and response examples.

Some of the Identity API operations require only the core authentication
service API v2.0 and some require extensions to the API. If an extension is
required, it is available in the Rackspace implementation of the OpenStack
Identity (keystone) service. You can learn how to create API requests and
understand the responses for operations that require extensions by reviewing
the sample requests and responses included in this API reference. For more
information about the available extensions, see :ref:`API extensions
<extensions-ovw>`.
