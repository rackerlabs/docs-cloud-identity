.. _delete-a-user-v2.0:

Delete a user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    DELETE /v2.0/users/{userId}

Rackspace Cloud account administrators (``identity:user-admin``) can use the
Delete user  operation to remove a user from a Rackspace Cloud account.
Administrators can only delete  user accounts that are assigned the user role
(``identity:default``) with the same tenant  id as the Administrator account.

To delete a user, specify the user ID in the request. If you know the user name
but not id,  use the :ref:`List users <get-list-users-v2.0>` operation to look
up account information by name.

.. warning::

   Donâ€™t delete the wrong user! Before submitting the Delete request, use the
   List users or :ref:`Get user by id <get-user-by-id-v2.0>` operation to
   review the user account information and confirm that you are working with
   the correct account.
