Forgot password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    POST /v2.0/users/RAX-AUTH/forgot-pwd

Use the Forgot password operation to get a password reset token delivered to
the email address associated with your account.

You can use the forgot password operation to reset the password through the
Identity API or Rackspace Control Panel.

    - To reset the password by using the API, submit the forgot password
      request without the portal attribute. After you submit the request, the
      user receives an email that contains a reset password token with
      directions to use it in the :ref:`Reset password <post-reset-pwd-v2.0>`
      operation.

    - To reset the password through the user interface, include the
      portal attribute in the forgot password API request. After you
      submit the request, the user receives an email that contains a link to
      the Rackspace user interface to change the password.

.. note::

   - The reset token has a limited lifespan. If the reset operation fails,
     submit another forgot password request to generate a new token.

   - An email is only sent if the username matches the existing user.

   - Forgot password operation will always return 204.

   - Resetting the password through the user interface is a restricted feature
     for Rackspace administrator and support users.
