Delete global role from user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code::

    DELETE /v2.0/users/{userId}/roles/OS-KSADM/{roleid}

Use this operation to delete a multi-product or custom (product-specific) role
from a  user account.

When you submit the request, include the system-assigned role ``id`` and user
``id``  in the request. Use the List role and List user operations to find the
correct ids.

The DELETE operation allows the account owner (identity:user-admin) to manage
non-protected role assignment for users (identity:default), granting and
revoking  access at will. Some roles like identity:rack_connect and
identity:rax_managed  cannot be managed by customers to prevent them from
revoking privileges unintentionally.
