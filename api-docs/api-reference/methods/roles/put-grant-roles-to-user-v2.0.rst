Grant roles to a user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

   PUT /v2.0/users/{userId}/RAX-AUTH/roles

Grant roles to a provisioned user. Existing roles set on the user that are not
being modified remain unchanged.

.. note::

   - The caller must have at least the ``identity:user-manage`` role. If the
     caller has only domain access, verify that the caller's domain matches
     the target user's domain.
   - The tenants on assignments must belong to the same domain as the target
     user's domain.
   - The role assignments cannot assign identity user type roles with the
     exception of ``identity:user-manage``.
   - The caller must be authorized to assign the specified roles.
   - The tenant assignments can include either ["*"] or a set of tenant ids.
   - This request effectively replaces any assignment that already exists for
     these roles on the user.
