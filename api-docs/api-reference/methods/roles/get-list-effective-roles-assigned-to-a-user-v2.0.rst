List effective roles assigned to a user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    GET /v2.0/users/{userId}/RAX-AUTH/roles

This operation returns the list of all roles that are assigned to the user with
the specified user Id. If you don't know the user ID, use the
:ref:`List users <get-list-users-v2.0>` operation with query parameter ``name``
to find it.

For each role listed, the response includes identifying information such as the
role ID, name, and the tenants to which the role is assigned, and the sources
that determined how the user received the role on the specified tenants.

This calls differs from the similar
:ref:`List global roles assigned to a user
<get-list-global-roles-assigned-to-a-user-v2.0>` call by:

- Including all means by which a user can be granted a role such as the
  following:

  - Through the user itself
  - Through membership in a user group
  - Through the system

- Including all forms of role assignment such as the following:

  - On domain
  - On individual tenants
  - On RCN

The :ref:`List global roles assigned to a user
<get-list-global-roles-assigned-to-a-user-v2.0>` accounts only for roles
assigned through the user on the domain.

.. note::

   - Users can always use this service to list roles for themselves.

   - Users with the ``identity:user-admin`` or ``identity:user-manage``
     role can list roles for users within their domain and with the
     ``identity:default`` role.

   - The service returns roles for provisioned users only. Returning roles for
     federated users is not yet supported.

Sources
-------
The response includes one or more sources for each role that the user has
assigned. Each source includes a source type, source id, assignment type, and
tenants on which that source granted the user the specified role.

SourceType and SourceId
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A user can receive a given role through multiple methods, as shown in the
following table.

.. list-table:: Source Type
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 60

   * - Type
     - Description
   * - USER
     - Direct role assignment to the user
   * - USERGROUP
     - Indirect assignment to the user via user groups
   * - SYSTEM
     - Identity System level functionality that automatically assigns certain
       roles

The ``sourceId`` identifies the id of the ``sourceType``. For example, the
``sourceId`` for the source with a ``USER`` source type is the ID of the
user to which the role was directly assigned, whereas the ``sourceId`` for a
``USERGROUP`` type would be the ID of the user group.

Assignment type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Role assignments are classified based on how the tenants, for which those
assignments apply, are determined. The classifications are shown in the
following table:

.. list-table:: Source type
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 60

   * - Type
     - Description
   * - DOMAIN
     - Assignment applied to all tenants within the user's domain.
   * - TENANT
     - Assignment only applies to tenants to which the role was explicitly
       assigned.
   * - RCN
     - Applies to all tenants across all domains within the RCN for which the
       RCN role applies.

**Across Domains Assignment Example Response**

This example depends on the following assumptions:

- ``d1t1`` and ``d1t2`` are tenants within the same domain (Domain 1).
- ``d2t1`` is a tenant in a different domain (Domain 2).
- The user has the 'observer' role assigned on tenant ``d1t1``, ``d1t2`` in
  Domain 1 and on tenant ``d2t1`` on Domain 2.

JSON::

 {
    "RAX-AUTH:roleAssignments": {
        "tenantAssignments": [
            {
                "onRole": "8899",
                "onRoleName": "observer",
                "forTenants": [
                     "d1t1",
                     "d1t2",
                     "d2t1"
                 ],
                "sources": [
                  {
                       "sourceType": "USER",
                       "sourceId": "userId",
                       "assignmentType": "DOMAIN",

                         "d1t1",
                         "d1t2",
                         "d2t1"
                     ]
                  }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
 }

**RCN Role Example Response**

This example depends on the following assumptions:

- The user's RCN contains the domain Domain 1 with the ``d1t1`` and ``d1t2``
  tenants.
- The user's RCN contains the domain Domain 2 with the ``d2t1`` tenants.
- The RCN role applies to all the mentioned tenants.

JSON::

 {
    "RAX-AUTH:roleAssignments": {
        "tenantAssignments": [
            {
                "onRole": "8899",
                "onRoleName": "rcn:admin",
                "forTenants": [
                   "d1t1",
                   "d1t2",
                   "d2t1"
                ],
                "sources": [
                   {
                      "sourceType": "USER",
                      "sourceId": "userId",
                      "assignmentType": "RCN"
                      "forTenants": [
                         "d1t1",
                         "d1t2",
                         "d2t1"
                      ]
                   }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
 }

**User without Tenants Example Response**

A user could be assigned a role that doesn't apply to *any* current tenants for
the user. For example, the user may have only DOMAIN roles on a domain with no
tenants. The user could also be assigned an RCN role that doesn't match any
tenant within the user's RCN. The service returns the role, but shows that that
source doesn't apply to any tenants.

This example depends on the following assumptions:

- The user's domain does not contain any tenants.
- The user has the ``identity:user-admin`` role.

JSON::

 {
    "RAX-AUTH:roleAssignments": {
        "tenantAssignments": [
            {
                "onRole": "3",
                "onRoleName": "identity:user-admin",
                "forTenants": [],
                "sources": [
                  {
                       "sourceType": "USER",
                       "sourceId": "userId",
                       "assignmentType": "DOMAIN"
                       "forTenants": []
                  }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
 }
