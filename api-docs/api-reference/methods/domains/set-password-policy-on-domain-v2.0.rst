.. _set-password-policy-on-domain-v2.0:

Set domain password policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    PUT /v2.0/RAX-AUTH/domains/{domainId}/password-policy

Set the domain's password policy. The policy allows authorized users to set a
password rotation requirement for all users within the domain. This forces
users to change their password after a specified time period. A User
administrator and User manager can set a policy on their own domain. System
and Identity administrators can set a policy on any domain. A password policy
is effective immediately for a domain.


.. note::

    - If the password on a user's account has been updated since the Identity
      3.12.0 release in June, 2017, Identity uses the date and time
      of the password change to determine whether the password has expired.
      Otherwise, Identity uses the last time any attribute on the account
      was updated (including password, email, and MFA settings).

    - Password policies can only be set using JSON. XML is not supported.

    - Regardless of the value set for ``passwordHistoryRestriction``, a user's
      password cannot be updated to its current password.
