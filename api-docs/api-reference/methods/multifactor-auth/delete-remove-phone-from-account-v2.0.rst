Remove phone from account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    DELETE /v2.0/users/{userId}/RAX-AUTH/multi-factor/mobile-phones

Removes a phone number associated with a user account to support multi-factor
authentication.

This operation removes the multi-factor authentication setting from your
account along  with all phones associated with the account. To disable the
feature without removing phones,  use the Disable multi-factor setting
operation.

This operation allows users and administrators to remove a mobile phone number
added to an account to support multi-factor authentication. You can remove the
number if multi-factor authentication is disabled, or if the user has decided
to  use an OTP device for multi-factor authentication.

This operation can only be completed from the user account submitting the
request.  Attempts to run it for a different user ID result in a 403 error
message.
