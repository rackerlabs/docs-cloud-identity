Send verfication code to phone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    POST /v2.0/users/{userId}/RAX-AUTH/multi-factor/mobile-phones/{phoneId}/verificationcode

This operation sends an SMS message with a PIN code to a phone added to an
account  for multi-factor authentication.

After you update an account with a mobile phone number for multi-factor
authentication,  Rackspace must confirm that the user has the phone before it
can be enabled for use in  the authentication process.

When you send the verification code, include the ``phoneId`` in the API
request. If you don't  know the ID, use the  :ref:`List multi-factor devices
associated with <get-multifactor-phones-for-user-v2.0>` operation to get it.

After you submit request, the Rackspace verification service sends a PIN to the
specified  phone via SMS text message. Each PIN has a system-defined expiration
time determined by  the Identity service system configuration. After receiving
the PIN, use the Verify a  mobile phone operation to submit the PIN to the
Identity service to confirm the device  for use with multi-factor
authentication services.

.. important::

   In the Send Verify request, the ``X-Auth-Token`` header parameter value
   must specify a  valid authentication token ID for the user account
   associated with the mobile phone.  If you submit an authentication token
   from any other account, the operation fails.
