Rackspace Cloud customers have :ref:`user <user-concept>` accounts that allow
them to access, configure, and  manage their Rackspace Cloud services and
account information. Each cloud account has  an :ref:`administrative owner
<auth-roles-svc-adm-usr>` (``user-admin``) and can also have  one or more
sub-user accounts that provide access to the Rackspace Cloud services available
on the account.

Use the following API operations to to create, review, update, and delete user
accounts,  account information, and account credentials.
