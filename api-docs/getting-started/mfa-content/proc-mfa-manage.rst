.. _auth-mfa-manage-accounts:

Manage multifactor-enabled accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users and administrators can complete the following tasks to manage accounts
that use  multi-factor authentication.

- :ref:`Unlock user account <auth-manage-unlock-account>`
- :ref:`Recover account <auth-manage-recover-account>`
- :ref:`Generate bypass codes <auth-manage-generate-bypass-codes>`
- :ref:`Check multi-factor status on user account <auth-manage-check-mfa-status>`
- :ref:`List multifactor-enabled devices by user id <auth-manage-list-mfa-devices-by-id>`
- :ref:`Disable multi-factor authentication on a user account <auth-manage-disable-mfa-user>`
- :ref:`Remove multi-factor authentication from user account <auth-remove-mfa-from-user>`


.. Important::

    Multi-factor authentication is supported only by Rackspace Cloud
    Identity service version 2.0 or later. After an account is enabled for
    multi-factor authentication, the user cannot authenticate using Identity
    service v1.0 or v1.1.

.. _auth-manage-unlock-account:

Unlock user account
-------------------

If your account is locked as a result of failed login attempts, wait 5 minutes and then
try to authenticate again using the passcode sent to your account. If you are still not
able to access your account, contact the User administrator to
:ref:`unlock your account <multifactor-operations>`.


.. _auth-manage-recover-account:

Recover account
---------------

If you cannot get the multi-factor authentication passcode from the device associated with
your account or from the saved bypass codes generated for your account, contact Rackspace Support.
