Service types
=============

The service catalog provides information about Rackspace Cloud services
that are available to customers who have successfully authenticated,
including the API service endpoints to access the service. You can view
:ref:`service catalog details <svccat-resource>` in the
authentication response returned by the Identity service.

Each service has a unique name and an associated service type that
identities the function that the service provides.

Service types in the catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every service listed in the catalog is associated with a service type.
You can use the service type to identify services that perform similar
functions, whatever those services are named.

The following table provides information about the service types
supported by the Rackspace Cloud. To learn more about any of the
Rackspace services listed, see the `Rackspace developer
documentation`_.

.. _auth-svccat-workflow:

Suggested work flow for processing a service catalog response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When your client issues a successful authentication request, the Cloud
Identity service returns a service catalog that lists the available
services and endpoints to access them. (See
:ref:`annotated-auth-req-resp` for a service catalog example.)

As the client developer, you must decide how your client can use the
contents of its service catalog. The first step is to identify a service
that you want the client to access. Following is one possible work flow
for processing the service catalog response to identify available
services and their endpoints:

-  If the service catalog lists only one endpoint, use it.

   This endpoint connects your client to the only service available.

-  If the service catalog lists multiple endpoints, establish a process
   for the client to select the endpoint for the connection:

   -  If the user does not specify which endpoint to use, generate an
      error.

   -  If the user specified which endpoint to use, help the user
      identify that endpoint from within the catalog:

      -  Support filtering by endpoint name, service name, service type,
         region name, and version.

      -  Support manual specification of an endpoint via a URL
         parameter.

..  tip::

    When you parse an authentication response programmatically, use the
    service `type` instead of service `name` as the basis for
    determining whether a user has access to a particular kind of service.
    Service type is stable across all releases; new service types can be
    added, but existing service types are not renamed. For example, if new
    compute services are added with different names, the service `type`
    filter returns all available services.

Â 
**Example: Connect a client to an endpoint listed as`type="compute"`.**

#. Navigate to the endpoint for the specified `compute` service, and
   use its `WWW-Authenticate` header to determine what authentication
   server it uses.

#. Go to that authentication server and authenticate.

#. Return to the `compute` endpoint and proceed with using the compute
   service.
