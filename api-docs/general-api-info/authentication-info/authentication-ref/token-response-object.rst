Token resource: authentication response attributes
--------------------------------------------------

The token object supplies a scoped authentication token that customers
and processes can use to access Rackspace Cloud services for the
specified tenant. Token scope is determined by tenant and user role
assignments for the authenticated user. Responses can be in
JSON or XML format as shown in the following examples. For details, see the
:ref:token object attribute descriptions <auth-resp-token-obj-attribs> in
the table following the examples.

You include the token ID returned in the response to verify your identity when
in subsequent API requests to Rackspace Cloud services, you

| `id`            | String    | The unique, system-assigned ID for the          |
|                 |           | authentication token. The token ID can be       |

|                 |           | authentication. Tokens are valid for a finite   |
|                 |           | duration; a token's default lifespan is         |
|                 |           | twenty-four hours. In the authentication        |
|                 |           | response example, the token is                  |
