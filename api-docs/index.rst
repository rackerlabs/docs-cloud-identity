===============================
Identity API |contract version|
===============================

*Last updated:* |today|

The Identity API service enables developers to manage
authentication and authorization services for Rackspace services
through a simple Representational State Transfer (REST) web service interface.

The Identity service v2.0 is an implementation of
OpenStack Keystone Service v2.0 that provides common, token-based
authentication and authorization services that allow seamless access to
Rackspace products and services.

-  Authentication generates a token in response to valid credentials
   submitted by a user, process, or client. Then, that token is used to
   confirm identity when requesting access to systems or resources
   defined in the Identity service catalog.

-  Authorization determines the resources and actions available to a
   user, client, or process based on access control capabilities that
   can be defined and managed by using the Identity
   service.

This guide is intended to assist software developers who want to develop
applications by using the REST application programming interface (API) for the
|product name| service.

To use the information provided here, you should have a general understanding
of the service and have access to an installation of it. You should also be
familiar with the following technologies:

   * RESTful web services
   * HTTP/1.1
   * JSON or XML serialization formats

Use the following links to get user and
reference information for using the Identity service REST
API.

.. note::

   You can also use |product name| from the Cloud Control Panel or by using
   one of the language-specific
   :rax-devdocs:`software development kits or the rack CLI <#sdks>`.
